Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another class. 
The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

Here we have made 5 classes to explain the concept of Inheritance in Java.
The 5 classes are Mouse, Mouse1, Mouse2, Mouse3, Main
The Mouse class contains the basic features of mouse that all mouse have like right and left click.
Mouse1, Mouse2, Mouse3 all have some specific features which applies to only them.
So to reduce the work we are inheriting all the basic methods that all mouses have into Mouse1, Mouse2 and Mouse3.
We won't have to write the same code again in any of the other classes as we have inherited class Mouse.
In class Main we are creating objects of Mouse1, Mouse2, Mouse3 to demonstrate how to use inheritance and calling the method of class Mousefrom objects of Mouse1, Mouse2, Mouse3.
