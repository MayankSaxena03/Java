Here we have created two classes Main and Laptop.
In OOP (Object Oriented Programming) we work with objects.
For understanding the concepts of OOP we are taking an example of physical laptop and defining its properties using multiple objects like storage, processor,etc.
We are creating a new Laptop object with defined properties in Main class.
We can create as many objects as we want and is required for the program.
